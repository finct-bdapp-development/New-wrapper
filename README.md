# New-wrapper

New Wrapper is used for all interactions with SQL.

Interaction with Access has been commented out and upon review could be removed to clean up the look of the code. 

05/04/2019 all versions of the Wrapper have been combined and redundant references have been removed. Two builds were then run on Debug and Release and DLL's and available.
